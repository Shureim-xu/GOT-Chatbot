GAME OF THRONES – MEGA KNOWLEDGE BASE (HYBRID EDITION)


House Stark is one of the oldest noble families in Westeros, descended from the First Men and known for their honor, loyalty, and connection to the North. They rule Winterfell, a massive fortress built thousands of years ago. The Starks are known for their solemn words, “Winter Is Coming”, a reminder of the harsh northern climate and impending danger. Members of House Stark play central roles in the political struggles across Westeros, as well as the supernatural conflicts involving the White Walkers.

House Lannister is one of the wealthiest and most influential houses, ruling from Casterly Rock. They are famed for their gold mines, political power, and cunning family members. The Lannisters are known for manipulation, ambition, and ruthless efficiency when threatened. Their unofficial motto, “A Lannister Always Pays His Debts,” reflects their wealth and reputation for vengeance.

House Targaryen is an ancient Valyrian lineage that once ruled the Seven Kingdoms for nearly 300 years. Their history is intertwined with dragons, conquest, and the Iron Throne. Despite being nearly destroyed, the last surviving Targaryens seek to reclaim their former glory. Dragons are central to Targaryen power, symbolizing both their divine right to rule and their destructive potential.

House Baratheon rose to power after Robert Baratheon overthrew the Mad King. The family is known for its strength, boldness, and storm-born temperament. They control Storm’s End, a nearly indestructible fortress built to withstand magical and physical assaults.

House Greyjoy rules the Iron Islands and follows the Old Way, a tradition celebrating reaving, independence, and strength at sea. Their culture values paying the “iron price,” taking what one needs by force rather than trade.

House Tyrell ruled the fertile lands of the Reach from Highgarden, known for diplomacy, wealth, and a vast network of alliances. They provide food to much of Westeros and use political marriages to maintain power.

House Martell rules Dorne, a desert kingdom in the far south known for its independence, unique customs, and fierce warriors. Martells are known for their motto “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken,” symbolizing resilience.
